# BasicHeroLayout

A basic hero layout with buttons and separate content "pages"/panels. Perfect for a profile or portfolio website. Menu adapts for mobile.

A live demo can be viewed at [rmak.net](https://rmak.net).

The layout uses HTML and CSS, as well as javascript to allow the buttons to control the content. 

The copyright notice in the footer may be commented out using <!-- and -->, but must remain on the page.
