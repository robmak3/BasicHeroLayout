# BasicHeroLayout

A basic hero layout with buttons and separate content "pages"/panels. Perfect for a profile or portfolio website. Menu adapts for mobile.

A live demo can be viewed at [rmak.net](https://rmak.net).

The layout uses HTML and CSS, as well as javascript to allow the buttons to control the content, all in the same file.

Before using, be sure to change the background image under the css style. There are divs near the bottom that you can write to for your website content.

The copyright notice in the footer may be commented out using `<!-- and -->,` but must remain on the page.
